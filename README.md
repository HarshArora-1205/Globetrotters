## Inspiration and Modifications

Globetrotters draws inspiration from Colt Steele's iconic YelpCamp project, which originally utilized EJS view engine and server-side rendering. In the spirit of innovation, this project has been reimagined using modern technologies. React was chosen for the frontend, providing a dynamic and engaging user interface, while React Final Form offers robust form handling capabilities. User experience is further elevated with the integration of React Toastify for user notifications.

## Challenges

While developing Globetrotters, I encountered several challenges that required creative solutions:

1. **Image Handling with React Final Form**: Integrating Cloudinary image uploads with React Final Form posed challenges due to controlled input behavior. Overcoming this involved careful manipulation of form state and handling image uploads with precision.

2. **User Authentication**: Adapting Passport, primarily designed for backend authentication, to work seamlessly with the frontend was a significant challenge. Leveraging the Context API helped manage user authentication states effectively.

3. **CORS Configuration**: During deployment, resolving CORS issues required fine-tuning the server's CORS configuration. Ensuring proper origin URLs and credentials were configured in the CORS options helped achieve a smooth user experience.

4. **Migration to React**: Migrating Colt Steele's YelpCamp project from EJS view engine to React while maintaining feature parity required thoughtful UI/UX design and integration of modern React libraries.

These challenges were opportunities for growth and learning, ultimately resulting in a more robust and feature-rich Globetrotters platform.
